# Novel Problem Generator

## Description

The Novel Problem Generator is an innovative project developed as part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course at Tel Aviv University.
It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to generate unique and challenging programming problems, evaluating them and improving them.

## Features

- Generates novel programming problems using GPT-4
- Customizable problem generation with various options
- Supports problem validation and improvement
- Exports problems in both JSON and Markdown formats

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anuk909/novel_problem_generator.git
   cd novel_problem_generator
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Security Notice

The human-eval package is used to run untrusted model-generated code, specifically solutions generated by the LLM.
You are strongly advised against running this code outside of a robust security sandbox.

## Usage

Here's an example of generating a problem with all features enabled:

```bash
# Set up Azure OpenAI key and endpoint (see Configuration section)

cd novel_problem_generator
python main.py --attempts 1 \
               --output-base-name all_features \
               --check-gpt-feedback \
               --improve-after-first-try \
               --use-cover-story \
               --use-topics \
               --use-field \
               --require-30-lines

python problems_to_markdown.py problems/all_features.jsonl md
```

After execution, you can find the generated problem in:

- JSON format: `problems/all_features.jsonl`
- Markdown format: `md/` directory

Run `python main.py --help` for a full list of available options and their descriptions.
The files under resources are arbitrary and it's possible to upgrade or change them as you want.

## Configuration

The project uses environment variables for sensitive configuration:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your Azure OpenAI API key
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: Your Azure OpenAI endpoint

You can set these variables in your shell or use a `.env` file (remember to add `.env` to your `.gitignore`).
