# Task ID: hard/5

## Prompt

```python
def sort_by_frequency_and_value(arr):
    """
    Write a function that takes a list of integers and sorts them based on the frequency of their occurrence in ascending order and by their value in descending order within the same frequency.

    For example, if the input is [4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3], the output should be [3, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4] because:
    - Number 3 and 6 occur once, sort them descending as [6, 3], then place them because of ascending order of frequency.
    - Number 5 occurs twice, and so does 4, but since we need descending order in the same frequency, the highest value (5) comes before 4.
    
    Note:
    - The input list is not guaranteed to be sorted in any order.
    - If all numbers occur with the same frequency, the output list should be sorted in descending order.
    - The function should be able to handle an empty list, returning an empty list in this case.
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    from collections import Counter
    def sort_by_frequency_and_value(arr):
        freq = Counter(arr)
        return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (freq[x], -x))
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3]) == [3, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4]
    assert candidate([]) == []
    assert candidate([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) == [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
    assert candidate([7, 6, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8]) == [6, 7, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5]
    assert candidate([9]) == [9]
```

## Entry Point

`sort_by_frequency_and_value`

## Extra Info

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Sort a list of integers based on the frequency of their occurrence in ascending order and by their value in descending order within the same frequency. Given a list of integers, sort and return the list accordingly. Ensure the function handles empty lists by returning an empty list.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: 
- 5, Sort Direction Conflict: The description specifies that the list should be sorted by frequency in "ascending order", yet the sorting within the same frequency should be by value in "descending order". However, the provided canonical solution sorts the entire list primarily by frequency in ascending order but then uses the value negatively without distinguishing whether they belong to the same frequency group or not. This will incorrectly prioritize higher values even possibly outside their frequency groups over higher frequencies. Sorting needs careful segregation between frequency grouping and value ordering within those groups.
- 4, Ambiguity in requirements: The problem statement needs to clarify the behavior when two numbers with different frequencies are compared. The phrase "sort them based on the frequency of their occurrence in ascending order" should explicitly state that when two numbers have the same value but different frequencies, those with lower frequencies should come first.
