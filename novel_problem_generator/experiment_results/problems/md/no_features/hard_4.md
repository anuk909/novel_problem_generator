# Task ID: hard/4

## Prompt

```python
def unique_substring_pairs(s, k):
    """
    Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, write a function that returns the number of unique pairs of substrings of `s` that are of length `k` and are anagrams of each other.

    A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. Anagrams are two strings that can be rearranged to form each other.

    Example:
        s = 'abba', k = 2 -> Possible pairs: ('ab', 'ba'), ('bb', 'bb'), so the output should be 2. 
        s = 'abcd', k = 2 -> No two substrings of length 2 are anagrams of each other, output should be 0.
        s = 'ifailuhkqq', k = 2 -> Possible pairs: ('if', 'fi'), ('fa', 'af'), ('iu', 'ui'), ('il', 'li'), ('uh', 'hu'), ('hk', 'kh'), ('kq', 'qk'); output should be 7.
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    from collections import Counter
    def substrings(s, k):
        for i in range(len(s) - k + 1):
            yield s[i:i+k]

    def is_anagram(s1, s2):
        return Counter(s1) == Counter(s2)

    count = 0
    sub = list(substrings(s, k))
    visited = set()
    for i in range(len(sub)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(sub)):
            if is_anagram(sub[i], sub[j]) and (sub[i], sub[j]) not in visited and (sub[j], sub[i]) not in visited:
                visited.add((sub[i], sub[j]))
                count += 1
    return count
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate('abba', 2) == 2
    assert candidate('abcd', 2) == 0
    assert candidate('ifailuhkqq', 2) == 7
    assert candidate('aaaaaaaaaa', 2) == 45
    assert candidate('xyzxyz', 3) == 1
```

## Extra Info

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the number of unique pairs of substrings of `s` that are of length `k` and are anagrams of each other. Examples: s = 'abba', k = 2 -> 2; s = 'abcd', k = 2 -> 0; s = 'ifailuhkqq', k = 2 -> 7.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: 
- 5, Problem Definition Error: The example given in the prompt `s = 'ifailuhkqq', k = 2 -> Possible pairs: ('if', 'fi'), ('fa', 'af'), ('iu', 'ui'), ('il', 'li'), ('uh', 'hu'), ('hk', 'kh'), ('kq', 'qk'); output should be 7.` is incorrect. For the string 'ifailuhkqq' and k = 2, possible pairs of anagrams of substrings should be fewer as many pairs listed do not appear in the string itself, such as ('fi'), being a reordering and not an actual substring found independently in the input string.
- 5, Algorithm Inefficiency: The provided canonical solution has a highly inefficient checking method for counting anagram pairs, using nested loops and generating all substring combinations, then comparing each combination if they are anagrams. This method leads to excessive computational complexity, potentially O(n^4) for large inputs, making it impractical for larger strings and k values.
- 4, Inaccurate Testing: The test cases in the `check` function presume the functionality based on the incorrect example explained in the problem statement (`s = 'ifailuhkqq', k = 2` expected result 7), which could lead to false positive testing and doesn't accurately validate the solution to the problem description.
