# Task ID: hard/2

## Prompt

```python
def rotate_and_multiply(matrix, k):
    """
    Given a square matrix (2D list) of integers and a positive integer k, rotate the matrix k times clockwise and then multiply all rotated matrix elements by k.

    For example:
    If matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] and k = 2,
    After 2 rotations, the matrix would be [[1, 2], [3, 4]] (as each 4 rotations bring it back to original).
    Then, multiplying each element by 2, the resultant matrix would be [[2, 4], [6, 8]].

    Note:
    - Rotating the matrix once clockwise entails moving each element to its right position with corners cycling around.
    - matrix will be a non-empty square matrix.

    Example of a single rotation for a 3x3 matrix:
    Starting from matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]],
    After one clockwise rotation, it becomes: [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def rotate(matrix):
        return [list(reversed(col)) for col in zip(*matrix)]
    for _ in range(k % 4):
        matrix = rotate(matrix)
    return [[element * k for element in row] for row in matrix]
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 2) == [[2, 4], [6, 8]]
    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 1) == [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]
    assert candidate([[1]], 3) == [[3]]
    assert candidate([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 4) == [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3) == [[7 * 3, 4 * 3, 1 * 3], [8 * 3, 5 * 3, 2 * 3], [9 * 3, 6 * 3, 3 * 3]]
```

## Entry Point

`rotate_and_multiply`

## Extra Info

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function that given a square matrix and an integer k, rotates the matrix k times clockwise and then multiplies each element by k.

Examples:
- For matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] and k = 2, the output should be [[2, 4], [6, 8]].
- For each rotation of a 3x3 matrix [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], it transforms to [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]].
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: 
- 4, Solution Format Mismatch: The canonical solution provided is defined with an incorrect structure that does not fit into the `rotate_and_multiply` function format as specified in the prompt. The solution is written outside of the function body and there is no clear function definition which follows the requested function signature `def rotate_and_multiply(matrix, k):`.
- 5, Incorrect Test Case Handling: The test cases in `check` function are incorrectly structured because they use assertions that expect the function `candidate` but the prompt's main function is `rotate_and_multiply`. This inconsistency can lead to confusion and errors when running the given tests in a real coding environment.
