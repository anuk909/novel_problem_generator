# Task ID: hard/2

## Prompt

```python
def interdimensional_timeflow(paths, queries):
    """
    In a world where parallel universes and time-bending devices exist, there is a unique temporal device called the Interdimensional Timeflow Manipulator. This device interconnects multiple universes with pathways that allow the bidirectional flow of time particles. Each pathway has a capacity limit representing the maximum amount of time particles that can be transmitted in each direction within a unit of time.

    Your task is to model this network as a bidirectional flow problem where each node represents a universe, and each edge has a bidirectional capacity associated with it.

    The function 'interdimensional_timeflow' should take the following parameters:
    - paths: A list of tuples representing the connections between universes. Each tuple is in the form (universe1, universe2, capacity), specifying that the connection is bidirectional with the given capacity.
    - queries: A list of tuples representing requests to move a certain volume of time particles between two universes. Each tuple is in the form (source_universe, destination_universe, desired_flow).

    The function should return a list of booleans, where each boolean corresponds to whether the desired flow in the corresponding query is possible within the constraints of the network. You are expected to implement an efficient algorithm suitable for potentially large networks.

    Example:
    If paths = [(1, 2, 10), (2, 3, 5), (1, 3, 10)], and queries = [(1, 3, 15), (1, 2, 5)],
    The result should be [True, True] because:
    - The maximum flow from universe 1 to 3 is 15, which accommodates the first query.
    - The maximum flow from universe 1 to 2 is 10, more than the 5 required by the second query.

## Canonical Solution

```python
    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    def bfs(capacity, source, sink, parent):
        visited = [False] * len(capacity)
        queue = deque([source])
        visited[source] = True

        while queue:
            u = queue.popleft()

            for v, cap in enumerate(capacity[u]):
                if not visited[v] and cap > 0:  # Not yet visited and capacity left
                    queue.append(v)
                    visited[v] = True
                    parent[v] = u
                    if v == sink:
                        return True
        return False

    def edmonds_karp(capacity, source, sink):
        n = len(capacity)
        parent = [-1] * n
        max_flow = 0

        while bfs(capacity, source, sink, parent):
            path_flow = float('Inf')
            s = sink

            while s != source:
                path_flow = min(path_flow, capacity[parent[s]][s])
                s = parent[s]

            v = sink
            while v != source:
                u = parent[v]
                capacity[u][v] -= path_flow
                capacity[v][u] += path_flow
                v = u

            max_flow += path_flow

        return max_flow

    node_count = max(max(u, v) for u, v, _ in paths) + 1
    capacity = [[0] * node_count for _ in range(node_count)]

    for u, v, cap in paths:
        capacity[u][v] += cap
        capacity[v][u] += cap

    result = []
    for source, sink, flow in queries:
        if edmonds_karp(capacity, source, sink) >= flow:
            result.append(True)
        else:
            result.append(False)

    return result
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([(1, 2, 10), (2, 3, 5), (1, 3, 10)], [(1, 3, 15), (1, 2, 5)]) == [True, True]
    assert candidate([(0, 1, 3), (1, 2, 4), (2, 3, 5), (3, 4, 6), (4, 0, 7)], [(0, 3, 10), (1, 4, 9), (0, 2, 3)]) == [False, True, True]
    assert candidate([(1, 2, 7), (2, 3, 6)], [(1, 3, 13), (1, 3, 12)]) == [False, False]
    assert candidate([(0, 1, 100), (1, 2, 100), (0, 2, 1)], [(0, 2, 1), (1, 2, 100), (0, 2, 101)]) == [True, True, False]
    assert candidate([(0, 1, 7), (1, 2, 6), (2, 3, 5), (3, 0, 6)], [(0, 3, 16)]) == [False]

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 18)
- 5, Unrealistic Example: The example provided in the prompt states that the maximum flow from universe 1 to 3 is 15 using paths (1, 2, 10) and (2, 3, 5), which is incorrect. According to the provided paths, the maximum flow from universe 1 to 3 should be only 5. This discrepancy between the description and actual network flow principles could lead to confusion.
