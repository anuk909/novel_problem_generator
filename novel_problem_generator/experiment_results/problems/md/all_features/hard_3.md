## Prompt

```python
def frontier_vortex_energy_distribution(vortices, queries):
    """
    In a fictional Wild West world, energy is distributed through interdimensional vortices arranged in a special kind of Binary Search Tree called the Frontier Vortex Energy Tree (FVET). Each node in this tree represents a vortex and is identified by a unique transaction ID processed through a blockchain network. Each node holds information about its energy level.

    Given the transaction IDs, in the form of BST node keys, and associated energy levels, construct this Binary Search Tree. Once the tree is constructed, your task is to perform a series of energy range queries. An energy range query specifies a lower and upper transaction ID boundary and asks for the total energy within this range.

     Each query is represented as a tuple (low, high), where low and high are the transaction IDs marking the boundary of the query. You need to efficiently calculate the total energy contained in the nodes within this boundary using augmented properties for faster range sum calculations.

    Example:
    vortices = [(5, 30), (3, 20), (8, 40), (1, 10), (4, 25), (7, 35)]
    queries = [(1, 4), (3, 7)]
    - For the range (1, 4), the expected energy sum is 55 (10 from node 1, 20 from node 3, and 25 from node 4).
    - For the range (3, 7), the expected energy sum is 80 (20 from node 3, 25 from node 4, and 35 from node 7).

    Note:
    - The BST nodes' keys are unique positive integers that represent transaction IDs.
    - Nodes' keys and energy levels are given as tuples (key, energy).

## Canonical Solution

```python
    class TreeNode:
        def __init__(self, key, energy):
            self.key = key
            self.energy = energy
            self.left = None
            self.right = None
            self.subtree_energy_sum = energy  # Augmented property for subtree sum

    def insert_bst(root, key, energy):
        if not root:
            return TreeNode(key, energy)
        elif key < root.key:
            root.left = insert_bst(root.left, key, energy)
            root.subtree_energy_sum += energy
        else:
            root.right = insert_bst(root.right, key, energy)
            root.subtree_energy_sum += energy
        return root

    def sum_range(node, low, high):
        if not node:
            return 0
        if low <= node.key <= high:
            total_energy = node.energy
            total_energy += sum_range(node.left, low, high)
            total_energy += sum_range(node.right, low, high)
        else:
            total_energy = 0
            if node.key > low:
                total_energy += sum_range(node.left, low, high)
            if node.key < high:
                total_energy += sum_range(node.right, low, high)
        return total_energy

    root = None
    for key, energy in vortices:
        root = insert_bst(root, key, energy)
    results = [sum_range(root, q[0], q[1]) for q in queries]
    return results

## Warnings

- Only 1 test cases found. Minimum recommended is 5.
- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 18)
- 5, Incorrect example explanation: The problem statement contains inconsistencies in the example explanation, particularly how the energy sums are calculated for the provided range queries. The explanation does not match provided data, causing potential misunderstanding and confusion for the solver.
- 5, Inefficient algorithm guidance: The recommended approach provided in the canonical solution appears inefficient, especially for large datasets. It uses simple traversal for summing node ranges without leveraging the BST properties effectively or recommending more sophisticated methods that could operate more efficiently, such as self-balancing trees or augmented BSTs.
- 4, Unrealistic problem cover story: The narrative involving "interdimensional vortices" and "Frontier Vortex Energy Tree" in a "Wild West world" feels thematically disjointed and could be confusing. This over-complexity in the storyline might detract from the core task, making it harder for participants to focus on the actual algorithmic challenges.
- 4, Missing complexity and constraint details: The problem lacks detail on critical constraints such as the number of vortices, number of queries, the range of transaction IDs, and energy levels. This omission hinders the ability to effectively gauge the expected efficiency and difficulty of the problem, complicating both solution planning and testing.
