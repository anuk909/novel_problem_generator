# Task ID: hard/8

## Prompt

```python
def hot_air_balloon_courtroom_decision(balloon_images, proposals):
    """
    Imagine we are trying to decide on the design for a new series of hot air balloons to be used in courtrooms as a novelty method to resolve certain types of cases efficiently. Each design proposal for these balloons is based on various characteristics captured in images.

    Your task is to write a function that takes in a list of images of balloon proposals (each image is represented as a 2D matrix of pixels) and a list of proposals (each represented as a dictionary containing an 'id' and an 'area' within an image that likely contains significant design elements).

    The function should rank each proposal by its effectiveness in a courtroom, based on the clarity and informativeness of content within the proposed 'area'. You must use computer vision concepts such as image clarity measurement or key feature extraction to quantitatively measure these attributes.

    For each proposal, if the 'id' does not match any in balloon_images, it should be flagged as 'invalid'.

    For example, if `balloon_images` are [{'id': 1, 'image': [[0, 255], [255, 0]]}], and `proposals` are [{'id': 1, 'area': {'top_left': (0, 0), 'bottom_right': (1, 1)}}], the effectiveness can be computed using statistical variance or other relevant metrics.

    Note:
    - All input is expected to be valid and well-formed according to the specification.
    - The 'area' in proposals is specified as a dictionary with 'top_left' (x, y) and 'bottom_right' (x, y) coordinates of the rectangle.

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def extract_area(image, area):
        x1, y1 = area['top_left']
        x2, y2 = area['bottom_right']
        return [row[x1:x2+1] for row in image[y1:y2+1]]

    def calculate_effectiveness(subimage):
        import numpy as np
        arr = np.array(subimage)
        return np.var(arr)

    balloon_dict = {balloon['id']: balloon['image'] for balloon in balloon_images}

    proposal_effectiveness = []
    for proposal in proposals:
        if proposal['id'] not in balloon_dict:
            proposal_effectiveness.append({'id': proposal['id'], 'effectiveness': 'invalid'})
            continue
        image = balloon_dict[proposal['id']]
        area = proposal['area']
        subimage = extract_area(image, area)
        effectiveness = calculate_effectiveness(subimage)
        proposal_effectiveness.append({'id': proposal['id'], 'effectiveness': effectiveness})

    sorted_proposals = sorted(proposal_effectiveness, key=lambda x: x['effectiveness'] if isinstance(x['effectiveness'], float) else float('-inf'), reverse=True)
    return sorted_proposals
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([
        {'id': 1, 'image': [[100, 100], [100, 100]]}
    ], [
        {'id': 1, 'area': {'top_left': (0, 0), 'bottom_right': (1, 1)}}
    ]) == [{'id': 1, 'effectiveness': 0.0}]

    assert candidate([
        {'id': 2, 'image': [[255, 0], [0, 255]]},
        {'id': 3, 'image': [[10, 100], [200, 50]]}
    ], [
        {'id': 2, 'area': {'top_left': (0, 0), 'bottom_right': (1, 1)}},
        {'id': 3, 'area': {'top_left': (0, 0), 'bottom_right': (1, 1)}}
    ]) == [{'id': 3, 'effectiveness': 5775.0}, {'id': 2, 'effectiveness': 10406.25}]

    assert candidate([
        {'id': 4, 'image': [[30, 60], [70, 90]]}
    ], [
        {'id': 4, 'area': {'top_left': (0, 0), 'bottom_right': (0, 0)}}
    ]) == [{'id': 4, 'effectiveness': 0.0}]

    assert candidate([
        {'id': 5, 'image': [[100, 255], [255, 100]]}
    ], [
        {'id': 5, 'area': {'top_left': (0, 0), 'bottom_right': (1, 1)}}
    ]) == [{'id': 5, 'effectiveness': 7246.25}]

    assert candidate([
        {'id': 6, 'image': [[0, 200], [200, 0]]}
    ], [
        {'id': 6, 'area': {'top_left': (0, 0), 'bottom_right': (1, 1)}}
    ]) == [{'id': 6, 'effectiveness': 10000.0}]

## Cover Story

['hot air balloon', 'courtroom']

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function that processes a list of images of balloon proposals (each image as a 2D pixel matrix) and proposals (each as a dictionary with 'id' and rectangle 'area'). Rank the proposals by courtroom effectiveness based on the clarity and informativeness of each 'area', using quantitative computer vision techniques. Flag proposals with non-matching 'id' as 'invalid'.

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 16)
- 5, Impractical scenario: The premise of using hot air balloon designs in courtrooms for case resolution is highly impractical and does not relate closely enough to real-world applications or typical problem-solving scenarios expected in coding competitions. This could confuse participants and detract from the problem's educational value.
- 4, Misalignment with noted topics: The problem statement includes "Subsets" and "Quickselect" as topics, but neither of these seems directly relevant to the primary task, which focuses on image processing and basic computational assessment of images. This may mislead participants regarding the skills and knowledge they should apply.
