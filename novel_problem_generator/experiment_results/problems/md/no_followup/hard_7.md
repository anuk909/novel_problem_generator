## Prompt

```python
def enchanted_treasure_map(values, operations):
    """
    In an enchanted lab in the arcane wild west, a treasure map has been divided into segments, each containing a different magical value. You are given a list of values, representing these segments. You must perform a series of operations to determine how to best navigate the map to unlock the greatest possible treasure.

    Specifically, there are two types of operations you can apply:

    1. "query l r": return the product of all prime numbers between indices l and r (inclusive).
    2. "update i v": update the value at index i with the new value v.

    The indices provided in the operations are 0-based. You must handle these operations in the order they are given.

    You need to provide an efficient solution given that both the number of values and operations can be very large.

    Example:
    values = [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
    operations = [
        'query 0 3',
        'update 3 11',
        'query 0 6'
    ]
    enchanted_treasure_map(values, operations) should return:
    [30, 2310]

    Where:
    - After the first query, the product of primes from index 0 to 3 is 2*3*5 = 30.
    - After updating index 3 to 11 (a prime), and then querying from index 0 to 6, the final result is 2*3*5*7*11 = 2310.

    Note:
    - Assume all inputs initially and updates will be positive integers.
    - The result from a 'query' operation may be very large, so consider overflow issues in languages with fixed integer precision.

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    from functools import reduce
    import operator

    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n <= 3:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

    def product_of_primes(a_list):
        primes = filter(is_prime, a_list)
        return reduce(operator.mul, primes, 1)

    treasure = values.copy()
    result = []
    for op in operations:
        if op.startswith('query'):
            _, l, r = op.split()
            l, r = int(l), int(r)
            segment = treasure[l:r+1]
            result.append(product_of_primes(segment))
        elif op.startswith('update'):
            _, i, v = op.split()
            i, v = int(i), int(v)
            treasure[i] = v
    return result
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10], ['query 0 3', 'update 3 11', 'query 0 6']) == [30, 2310]
    assert candidate([10, 15, 21, 5, 3], ['update 2 2', 'query 1 3']) == [5]
    assert candidate([3, 5, 8, 10, 11], ['query 0 3', 'update 4 12', 'query 2 4']) == [15, 8]
    assert candidate([7, 5, 3, 2, 11, 20], ['query 0 5', 'update 5 17', 'query 3 5', 'update 3 19', 'query 0 5']) == [2310, 187, 651930]
    assert candidate([], []) == []

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Create a function for performing operations on a list of integer values, including 'query' operations that compute the product of all primes in specific sub-array segments, and 'update' operations to change elements at specific indices. This function should also efficiently handle very large inputs and provide correct products considering updated values, given operations happen sequentially.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 31)
- 5, Logical error in prime detection: The provided prime check fails to correctly identify primes and non-primes for larger ranges or specific numbers due to its simplistic and partially incorrect implementation. A correct prime checking algorithm is crucial for the task as all operations rely on this to determine which values to multiply. Failing to correctly identify primes can lead to incorrect results from queries.
- 4, Performance inefficiency: The problem statement suggests potentially large input sizes and requires handling operations efficiently. However, the provided solution recalculates prime products from scratch within every query without utilizing any advanced data structures like Segment Trees or Binary Indexed Trees for efficient querying and updates. This leads to poor time complexity especially when multiple operations are performed on large inputs.
