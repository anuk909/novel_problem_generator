# Task ID: hard/5

## Prompt

```python
def sports_stars_coverage(connections, queries):
    """
    Imagine a smart sports facility where each athlete is equipped with an IoT device. These devices are connected in a tree structure representing the communication between athletes. Each athlete can communicate directly with their designated coach or other athletes linked in the tree. The root of the tree is the head coach.

    Write a function that determines the number of nodes (athletes) within a given range from a query node using a two-pointers strategy.

    Arguments:
    - connections: List of tuples (a, b), representing a communication link between athlete a and b.
    - queries: List of tuples (a, d), where 'a' is the athlete number (node in the tree), and 'd' is the distance from that node.

    For example:
    If the connections are [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)], and the queries are [(2, 1)], the output should be [3] because athlete 2 can communicate with athletes 4 and 5 directly and itself, making a count of 3 athletes within a distance of 1.

    Constraints:
    - Each athlete has a unique number and there are no cycles.

    Note:
    - Return a list of integers, each representing the result of the corresponding query.

## Canonical Solution

```python
	def sports_stars_coverage(connections, queries):
	    from collections import defaultdict, deque

	    # Create adjacency list for the tree
	    graph = defaultdict(list)
	    for a, b in connections:
	        graph[a].append(b)
	        graph[b].append(a)

	    results = []
	    for node, distance in queries:
	        # BFS to find nodes within the distance
	        visited = set()
	        queue = deque([(node, 0)])
	        visited.add(node)
	        count = 0

	        while queue:
	            current, dist = queue.popleft()
	            count += 1
	            if dist < distance:
	                for neighbor in graph[current]:
	                    if neighbor not in visited:
	                        visited.add(neighbor)
	                        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))

	        results.append(count)
	    return results
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)], [(2, 1)]) == [3]
    assert candidate([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)], [(1, 2)]) == [3]
    assert candidate([(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4)], [(3, 0)]) == [1]
    assert candidate([(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 5)], [(1, 1)]) == [4]
    assert candidate([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)], [(4, 2)]) == [4]

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Define a function `sports_stars_coverage(connections, queries)` where:
- `connections` is a list of tuples denoting direct communication between two athletes.
- `queries` is a list of tuples (node, distance) for which nodes counts should be fetched within the specified distance.
Examples are given to clarify inputs and expected output.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 19)
- 5, Misleading Technique Description: The problem statement mentions using a two-pointers strategy to solve the problem. However, the nature of the problem which involves traversing trees with varying tree levels and branching is typically not suited for a two-pointer technique. The provided canonical solution uses BFS (Breadth-First Search), which is a more appropriate method for this kind of tree traversal task. The mention of two-pointers is misleading and incorrect for the described problem framework.
