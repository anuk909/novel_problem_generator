# Task ID: hard/9

## Prompt

```python
def control_cloaked_robots(arrival_times, departure_times, distances):
    """
    In a futuristic robotic theme park, a new attraction involves robots equipped with invisibility cloaks. These robots travel along paths that intersect at various points in the park. To sustain the illusion of invisibility and avoid clashes that might make them visible, your task is to make schedules where robots' paths do not overlap at the same time.

    Each robot has a scheduled path characterized by an arrival time, a departure time, and the distance of the path they need to cover. Whenever two or more robots would overlap on any path segment at the same time, they risk becoming visible, and the magic is lost.

    Your task is to write a function that, given lists of arrival times, departure times, and distances of paths that each robot takes, uses an algorithm similar to Kruskal’s minimum spanning tree to prevent path overlaps, maximizing the number of robots that can use their paths without risk of visibility.

    For example:
    - If the input is arrival_times = [1, 2, 3], departure_times = [3, 5, 10], distances = [2, 3, 4], the output should be 2 since the first two robots can finish their paths without overlapping and without risk of being visible.

    Parameters:
    - arrival_times (List[int]): List of times when each robot begins its path.
    - departure_times (List[int]): List of times when each robot ends its path.
    - distances (List[int]): The lengths of paths each robot travels. These are crucial for spacing requirements.

    Returns:
    - int: The maximum number of non-overlapping schedules that can be drawn.
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    from heapq import heappop, heappush

    # Merge intervals using a modified Kruskal's algorithm approach
    def control_cloaked_robots(arrival_times, departure_times, distances):
        robots = sorted(zip(arrival_times, departure_times, distances), key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
        pq = []
        count = 0
        for start, end, distance in robots:
            if pq and pq[0][0] <= start:
                heappop(pq)
            heappush(pq, (end, distance))
            count += 1
        return count
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 10], [2, 3, 4]) == 2
    assert candidate([1, 3, 2], [2, 5, 4], [1, 2, 1]) == 2
    assert candidate([1, 1, 1], [3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3]) == 1
    assert candidate([], [], []) == 0
    assert candidate([1, 0, 3, 5], [4, 2, 4, 7], [3, 2, 1, 2]) == 3

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
def control_cloaked_robots(arrival_times, departure_times, distances):
    """
    Schedule robots with invisibility cloaks on paths without overlapping to maximize the number of robots that can use their paths without becoming visible.

    Example:
    - For arrival_times = [1, 2, 3], departure_times = [3, 5, 10], distances = [2, 3, 4], the output should be 2 since the first two robots can finish their paths without overlapping.

    Parameters:
    - arrival_times (List[int])
    - departure_times (List[int])
    - distances (List[int])

    Returns:
    - int: The maximum number of non-overlapping robot schedules.

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: 
- 5, Incorrect Algorithm Referenced: The problem statement refers to using an algorithm similar to "Kruskal’s minimum spanning tree" for scheduling robots which is misleading or incorrect because Kruskal's algorithm is used for finding a minimum spanning tree in a graph, not for scheduling or handling interval overlaps. A more appropriate reference might be to interval scheduling maximization algorithms or greedy algorithms for interval selection.
- 4, Misuse of "distances" in the solution: The distances parameter in the robotic scheduling problem seems to have no actual impact or relevance in the provided solution even though the prompt mentions these distances as "crucial for spacing requirements." This may confuse competitors about the role distances should play in solving, potentially leading to incorrect implementations.
