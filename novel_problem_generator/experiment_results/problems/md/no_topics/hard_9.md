# Task ID: hard/9

## Prompt

```python
def spell_similarity(spell1, spell2):
    """
    In a mystical wizard school, spells consist of sequences of magic glyphs represented by characters. Each spell has a unique sequence of glyphs.
    Your task is to determine the similarity between two spells based on their magic glyph sequences using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (a bioinformatics algorithm commonly used for sequence alignment).

    The similarity is calculated based on the following clearly defined scoring:
    - Match: +2 (when two corresponding glyphs match)
    - Mismatch: -1 (when two corresponding glyphs are different)
    - Gap: -2 (when a glyph is aligned with a gap in the other spell)

    Explicitly handle edge cases such as when either or both of the spells are empty. The score for aligning two empty spells is 0.

    For example, if spell1 is 'ABC' and spell2 is 'AEC', the maximum alignment score (similarity) would be 2 (A matches A, B to gap, C matches C: +2 -2 +2).
    Another example is for spell1 'AB' and spell2 'A', the maximum alignment score would be 0 (A matches A, B to gap: +2 -2).

    Parameters:
        spell1 (str): A string representing the glyph sequence of the first spell.
        spell2 (str): A string representing the glyph sequence of the second spell.

    Returns:
        int: The similarity score between the two spells.

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def spell_similarity(spell1, spell2):
        import numpy as np
        def score(a, b):
            if a == b:
                return 2  # Match score
            elif a == '-' or b == '-':
                return -2  # Gap score
            else:
                return -1  # Mismatch score
        
        n, m = len(spell1), len(spell2)
        dp = np.zeros((n + 1, m + 1), dtype=int)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] - 2  # Initializing gaps
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] - 2  # Initializing gaps
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                match = dp[i-1][j-1] + score(spell1[i-1], spell2[j-1])
                delete = dp[i-1][j] - 2
                insert = dp[i][j-1] - 2
                dp[i][j] = max(match, delete, insert)
        return dp[n][m]
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate('ABC', 'AEC') == 2
    assert candidate('AB', 'A') == 0
    assert candidate('ABC', 'ABC') == 6
    assert candidate('ABC', 'DEF') == -3
    assert candidate('A', 'B') == -3
    assert candidate('HELLO', 'HELLO') == 10
    assert candidate('', '') == 0
    assert candidate('WIZARD', 'WZRD') == 4
    assert candidate('MAGIC', 'MAGICAL') == 2
```

## Cover Story

['wizard school', 'magic glyphs']

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Define a function that calculates the similarity score between two strings (spells) using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with match score +2, mismatch score -1, and gap score -2, including explicit handling for edge cases where either or both of the spells might be empty.

Examples:
- 'ABC' vs 'AEC' should return a similarity score of 2.
- 'AB' vs 'A' should return a similarity score of 0.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: 
- 5, Clarity in Problem Statement: The problem statement mentions the use of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which is generally understood but does not provide the exact implementation details required for proper scoring and alignment, such as initialization of boundary conditions in the dynamic programming table.
- 4, Ambiguity in Edge Cases: The statement provides initial guidance for edge cases, such as handling empty strings, but does not clearly define behavior for sequences of massive length difference, which may lead to inefficient performance without proper optimization techniques being highlighted.
