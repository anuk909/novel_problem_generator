To sustain the illusion of invisibility and avoid clashes that might make them visible, your task is to make schedules where robots' paths do not overlap at the same time.\n\n    Each robot has a scheduled path characterized by an arrival time, a departure time, and the distance of the path they need to cover. Whenever two or more robots would overlap on any path segment at the same time, they risk becoming visible, and the magic is lost.\n\n    Your task is to write a function that, given lists of arrival times, departure times, and distances of paths that each robot takes, uses an algorithm similar to Kruskal\u2019s minimum spanning tree to prevent path overlaps, maximizing the number of robots that can use their paths without risk of visibility.\n\n    For example:\n    - If the input is arrival_times = [1, 2, 3], departure_times = [3, 5, 10], distances = [2, 3, 4], the output should be 2 since the first two robots can finish their paths without overlapping and without risk of being visible.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - arrival_times (List[int]): List of times when each robot begins its path.\n    - departure_times (List[int]): List of times when each robot ends its path.\n    - distances (List[int]): The lengths of paths each robot travels.
