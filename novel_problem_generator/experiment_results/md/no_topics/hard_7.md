# Task ID: hard/7

## Prompt

```python
def decrypt_pirate_message(encoded_message, key):
    """
    In a tale of high seas adventure, a secret agent intercepts a message from pirates that is encoded using a sophisticated encryption method. This method comprises two layers. First, each alphabetic character is shifted using a Caesar Cipher where the shift amount is the position in the alphabet (i.e., 'a' and 'A' are shifted by 1, 'b' and 'B' by 2, etc.). Second, for both alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters, a XOR operation is applied using the ASCII values of the characters and a repeating key pattern.

    Your task is to decrypt this intercepted message given the encoded_message and a key. Assume non-alphabetic characters are not shifted in the Caesar Cipher but are still processed in the XOR operation.

    Example inputs and outputs:
    - If the encoded message is '@EPPCQ' (where '@' remains '@' after Caesar since it's non-alphabetic) and the key is 'abc', the output after full decryption should be 'hello'. In this case, the shifting only applies to letters.

    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def decrypt_pirate_message(encoded_message, key):
        # First decode using Caesar Cipher
        def shift(char, amount):
            if char.isalpha():
                base = ord('a') if char.islower() else ord('A')
                return chr((ord(char) - base - amount + 26) % 26 + base)
            return char

        # Shift each letter by its position
        first_level_decoded = ''.join(shift(char, i + 1 if char.lower() >= 'a' and char.lower() <= 'z' else 0) for i, char in enumerate(encoded_message))

        # Now apply XOR with the key
        key_extended = (key * ((len(first_level_decoded) // len(key)) + 1))[:len(first_level_decoded)]
        decoded_message = ''.join(chr(ord(char) ^ ord(key_char)) for char, key_char in zip(first_level_decoded, key_extended))

        return decoded_message

```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate('@EPPCQ', 'abc') == 'hello'
    assert candidate('QTVPW', 'key') == 'start'
    assert candidate(']^[YcVR`SVR', 'abc') == 'encryption'
    assert candidate('BBB', 'b') == 'aaa'
    assert candidate('\x7f\x90\x91', 'key') == 'abc',

```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
def decrypt_pirate_message(encoded_message, key):
    """
    Decrypt an encoded message following these steps:
    - Use a Caesar Cipher that only shifts alphabetic characters backward by their position in the alphabet.
    - Apply a XOR operation on the ASCII values of all characters (including non-alphabetic ones) with those of a repeating key to decrypt the message.

    Example:
    - For encoded_message='@EPPCQ' and key='abc', the decrypted result should be 'hello'.

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 33)
- 5, Logical Inconsistency: The description implies that characters are shifted backward only for the Caesar Cipher based on their position (e.g., 'a' by 1), which contradicts typical Caesar Cipher mechanics where all letters are shifted by a uniform value. Furthermore, the example '@EPPCQ' when decoded under these rules inexplicably decrypts to 'hello' based on the approach described which seems either incorrect or misleading due to the unclear shifting backward mechanism.
- 4, XOR Clarification Missing: The description is insufficiently clear on how the key is used in the XOR operation. The prompt should specify if the key needs to undergo transformation or extension to match the length of the message or if the key should be used directly as is, particularly as the solution logic extends the key.
