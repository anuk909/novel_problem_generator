# Task ID: hard/4

## Prompt

```python
def decode_message(messages, model):
    """
    Imagine a scenario where messages are transmitted but are scrambled so that the words are out of order but the message content is intact. Your task is to reconstruct the original message using natural language processing techniques.

    Each message received is a string of words separated by spaces. Words can contain letters and occasionally punctuation, like commas or periods. The capitalization of the words may vary.

    Write a function that takes a list of scrambled messages and an NLP model, and returns a list of messages with the words in the most likely original order. Use the provided NLP model to determine the optimal order of words based on language understanding.

    Input details:
    - The messages list will contain between 0 and 10 scrambled messages.
    - Each message will contain between 1 and 10 words.

    Example:
    - messages: ['universe is mysterious The', 'very deck observatory, the on is cold The']
    - model: a preloaded NLP model you can utilize to process text
    Output:
    - ['The universe is mysterious', 'The deck on the observatory is very cold']
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def decode_message(messages, model):
        decoded_messages = []
        for message in messages:
            words = message.split()
            permutations = itertools.permutations(words)
            best_sentence = None
            max_prob = 0
            for perm in permutations:
                sentence = ' '.join(perm)
                doc = model(sentence)
                prob = sum([tok.prob for tok in doc])
                if prob > max_prob:
                    max_prob = prob
                    best_sentence = sentence
            decoded_messages.append(best_sentence)
        return decoded_messages
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    import spacy
    nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
    assert candidate(['universe is mysterious The'], nlp) == ['The universe is mysterious']
    assert candidate(['The scrambled this, is message'], nlp) == ['This message is scrambled,']
    assert candidate(['fog heavy, through the communicate We'], nlp) == ['We communicate through the heavy fog']
    assert candidate(['stars curious observe the to continue We'], nlp) == ['We continue to observe the curious stars']
    assert candidate([], nlp) == []
```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function that takes a list of scrambled messages and an NLP model, and returns the messages with words in their likely original order. The NLP model helps to understand the most probable construction of sentences. Each message will have words that might be out of order and is separated by spaces.
Example:
- Input: ['universe is mysterious The'], NLP model
  Output: ['The universe is mysterious']
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: No module named 'spacy'
- 4, Combinatorial Explosion: The provided canonical solution suggests generating all permutations of words in the message to determine the best order. Given that each message can contain up to 10 words, this would result in up to 3,628,800 permutations (10 factorial) per message. This approach is computationally infeasible for larger input sizes, making the solution impractical for real-world applications, especially with the upper message limit of 10.
- 5, Incomplete Model Use Explanation: The problem statement lacks detailed information on how the given NLP model should be used to evaluate the probability of the correctness of each permutation of the words. This lack of detail could lead to different interpretations and implementations, causing inconsistent results and difficulties in understanding and using the provided NLP model correctly.
- 4, Testing Limitations: The test cases provided assume that there is exactly one correct order for the scrambled messages, which contradicts the acknowledgment of multiple plausible outputs stated in the problem. This could lead to incorrect testing and validation of the candidate's solution, potentially causing confusion and inaccuracies in the assessment process.
