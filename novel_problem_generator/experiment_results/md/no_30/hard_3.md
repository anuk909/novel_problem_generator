# Task ID: hard/3

## Prompt

```python
def enchanted_sudoku_solver(puzzle, enchanted_mask):
    """
    Solve an 'Enchanted Sudoku' puzzle where:
    - Each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid must contain the digits 1-9 with no repetition.
    - Specific cells, marked by a corresponding bitmask (1 denotes enchanted, 0 denotes normal), need to fulfill additional conditions if they are enchanted:
       * The sum of the enchanted cells in any row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid must total 15, if there are exactly three enchanted cells in that row, column or sub-grid.
       * If there are less than three or more than three enchanted cells in a row, column or sub-grid, they do not need to satisfy the sum of 15 condition.

    The task is to complete the Sudoku puzzle respecting both the usual Sudoku rules and the enchanted cell constraints.

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
def enchanted_sudoku_solver(puzzle, enchanted_mask):
    Solve an 'Enchanted Sudoku' puzzle considering the standard Sudoku rules and additional enchanted cells rules. Enchanted cells in groups of exactly three must together add up to 15. The function takes as inputs a 9x9 Sudoku grid 'puzzle' and a 9x9 binary grid 'enchanted_mask' where 1 denotes an enchanted cell and 0 denotes a normal cell.
    Example usage is shown below.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 10)
- 5, Incomplete function implementation: The canonical_solution provided for the enchanted_sudoku_solver function does not handle resetting the enchanted_sum and enchanted_count properly within blocks and rows/columns. This can lead to inaccurate counting and summing of enchanted cells, making the function unreliable for determining if the enchanted cell conditions are met.
- 5, Logical flaw in is_valid function: The is_valid function updates the enchanted_sum and enchanted_count for a row, column, and block without taking into account only the cells filled so far. It should only update these based on already filled cells rather than including zeros, which represent unfilled cells in Sudoku.
- 4, Canonical solution inefficiency: The canonical_solution seems to lack optimization for backtracking, potentially leading to high computational time, especially without efficient pruning when invalid conditions are detected early.
