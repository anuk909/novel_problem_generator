# Task ID: hard/7

## Prompt

```python
def correct_messages_for_sun_library(messages, key):
    """
    A library in Sun Village is facing a problem. Every day they receive encrypted digital messages that should be displayed on the welcome screen. However, the library system is old and tends to corrupt the encrypted messages by randomly switching characters within each message. Your task is to write a function that decrypts these messages using a given key and then corrects them by finding the lexicographically smallest rotation.

    Each message is decrypted by XOR-ing the ASCII values of its characters with the key. After decryption, to correct the message, find the lexicographically smallest rotation of the resulting string.

    The function takes two parameters: a list of encrypted messages (string list) and an integer key. The function should return a list of corrected decrypted messages.

    Example:
    messages = ['Cde', 'Bfg']
    key = 2
    Output: ['abc', 'def']
    Explanation:
    - 'Cde' -> Decoded with key 2: 'abc' (then rotated to 'abc')
    - 'Bfg' -> Decoded with key 2: 'def' (then rotated to 'def')
    The decrypted strings are rotated to achieve the smallest lexicographical order.
    """
```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def rotate_to_min(s):
        return min(s[i:] + s[:i] for i in range(len(s)))

    def correct_messages_for_sun_library(messages, key):
        corrected_messages = []
        for message in messages:
            decrypted = ''.join(chr(ord(char) ^ key) for char in message)
            min_rotation = rotate_to_min(decrypted)
            corrected_messages.append(min_rotation)
        return corrected_messages
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate(['Cde', 'Bfg', 'Zgh'], 2) == ['abc', 'def', 'xyz']
    assert candidate(['Ifmmp$', 'xPsmE!'], 1) == ['helloz', 'worldz']
    assert candidate(['Vjg', 'uwrgt'], 1) == ['the', 'super']
    assert candidate([], 10) == []
    assert candidate(['qRs'], 4) == ['mno']
```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
def correct_messages_for_sun_library(messages, key):
    """
    Decrypt messages encoded with XOR using a given key and correct by finding the smallest lexicographical rotation.

    Parameters:
    - messages: List of encrypted message strings.
    - key: Integer used for decryption.

    Returns:
    - Decrypted and correctly rotated messages as a list.

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 17)
- 4, Ambiguity in Character Set: The prompt does not specify the expected character set for the input strings. This could lead to different results depending on the interpretation, particularly for non-alphanumeric characters (like '!', '$').
- 4, Definition of "Correct" Rotation: It's not clearly explained why the lexicographically smallest rotation is considered the "correct" one for display purposes beyond the technical decryption. The rationale behind this selection criterion could use further elaboration to avoid confusion about the goals of the function.
