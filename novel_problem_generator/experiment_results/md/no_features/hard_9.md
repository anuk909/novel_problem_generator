## Prompt

```python
def longest_unique_subsequence(arr):
    """
    Write a function longest_unique_subsequence that takes a list of integers `arr` and finds the longest contiguous subsequence of the list such that all numbers in that subsequence are unique. A subsequence here refers to a sequence that can be derived from the list by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

    The function should return the length of the longest contiguous unique subsequence.

    If the list is empty, the function should return 0.

    Examples:
    - longest_unique_subsequence([4, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 3]) should return 4 (possible subsequence is [4, 3, 5, 2]).
    - longest_unique_subsequence([1, 1, 1]) should return 1 (only one unique number). 
    - longest_unique_subsequence([]) should return 0.

    Notes:
    - The input will not contain any elements other than integers.
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    unique_counter = {}
    max_length = 0
    l_index = 0
    for r_index, num in enumerate(arr):
        if num in unique_counter and unique_counter[num] >= l_index:
            l_index = unique_counter[num] + 1
        unique_counter[num] = r_index
        max_length = max(max_length, r_index - l_index + 1)
    return max_length
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([4, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 3]) == 4
    assert candidate([1, 1, 1]) == 1
    assert candidate([3, 5, 3, 2, 5]) == 4
    assert candidate([]) == 0
    assert candidate([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 6
    assert candidate([9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 8, 9]) == 3
```

## Entry Point

`longest_unique_subsequence`

## Extra Info

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Create a function that takes a list of integers and returns the length of the longest contiguous subsequence where all numbers are unique. The sequence should be derived by keeping the order intact while possibly removing elements.

Examples:
longest_unique_subsequence([4, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 3]) should return 4.
longest_unique_subsequence([1, 1, 1]) should return 1.
longest_unique_subsequence([]) should return 0.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: 
- 5, Incorrect terminology: The problem statement incorrectly uses the term "subsequence." A subsequence can have non-consecutive elements from the list, which contradicts the requirement for the elements to be contiguous. The correct term should be "subarray" or "contiguous subsegment."
- 4, Unclear edge case handling: The explanation on how to handle potential negative numbers, maximum array sizes, or performance implications on very large arrays is missing. This can lead to inefficient solutions or unexpected errors in certain edge cases.
