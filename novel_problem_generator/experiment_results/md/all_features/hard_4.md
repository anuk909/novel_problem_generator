## Prompt

```python
def mystical_chain_combinations(start, blocks, K):
    """
    In a mystical jungle combined with fairy tale elements, there's a blockchain that controls magical barriers. The blockchain consists of blocks represented as nodes in a doubly linked list. Each node contains a magic number. In the world of fairy tales, you find some blocks in the form of a doubly linked list starting from the given block 'start'.

    The kingdom's emperor is pondering about the security of their realm. He wants to calculate how many secure blockchain combinations can be generated from the given set of blocks. A combination is called secure if the product of the magic numbers from the selected blocks in a sequence is not divisible by the given integer 'K'.

    Write a function that calculates how many secure combinations of the doubly linked list blocks can be made from a continuous sequence of blocks such that no combination's product of magic numbers is divisible by 'K'. The sequences should be unique (i.e., different starting or ending block).

    Note:
    - Constraints: List size (1 <= size <= 1000), Magic numbers (1 <= magic number <= 10^9), K (1 <= K <= 10^9).
    - If 'start' is None or there are not enough blocks to form any sequence, return 0.
    - Start could be any block and can traverse forward or backwards using the doubly-linked nature.
    - Assume that each function call will provide enough blocks that can generate at least one valid combination.

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def is_magic_product_secure(blocks, K):
        count_secure = 0
        n = len(blocks)
        for start in range(n):
            product = 1
            for end in range(start, n):
                product *= blocks[end]
                if product % K != 0:
                    count_secure += 1
        return count_secure

    # Convert linked list to list
    numbers = []
    ptr = start
    if not ptr:
        return 0
    while ptr:
        numbers.append(ptr.magic)
        ptr = ptr.next

    return is_magic_product_secure(numbers, K)
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, magic, next=None, prev=None):
            self.magic = magic
            self.next = next
            self.prev = prev

    # Creating the doubly linked list from array
    def create_doubly_linked_list(arr):
        head = Node(arr[0])
        current = head
        if len(arr) == 1:
            return head
        for num in arr[1:]:
            new_node = Node(num)
            current.next = new_node
            new_node.prev = current
            current = new_node
        return head

    # Test cases
    blocks1 = create_doubly_linked_list([1, 2, 3, 4])
    assert candidate(blocks1, 2) == 4

    blocks2 = create_doubly_linked_list([7, 11, 13, 17])
    assert candidate(blocks2, 5) == 15

    blocks3 = create_doubly_linked_list([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])
    assert candidate(blocks3, 3) == 0

    blocks4 = create_doubly_linked_list([3, 6, 1, 5])
    assert candidate(blocks4, 2) == 11

    blocks5 = create_doubly_linked_list([19, 23, 29, 31])
    assert candidate(blocks5, 7) == 15

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function 'mystical_chain_combinations' that takes in 'start', a node of a doubly linked list representing a chain of magical blocks, and a number 'K'. The function should return the number of unique, secure combinations of blocks.

    A sequence of blocks is secure if the product of their numbers (magic numbers) is not divisible by 'K'. Every block has a 'magic' number. 'Start' indicates the initial block, and blocks can be accessed forwards and backwards. Return count of all secure sequences.

    Note:
    - Constraints: List size (1 <= size <= 1000), Magic numbers (1 <= magic number <= 10^9), K (1 <= K <= 10^9).
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: mystical_chain_combinations() missing 1 required positional argument: 'K'
- 5, Inconsistent Behavior with Assumptions: The prompt states that "Assume that each function call will provide enough blocks that can generate at least one valid combination," but the canonical solution explicitly handles cases where `start` is `None` or the blockchain is too short, returning `0`. This contradiction might lead to confusion for users as to what scenarios the function should correctly handle.
- 4, Unclear Execution with Backward Traversal: Although the prompt mentions the ability to traverse backward due to the doubly-linked nature of the list, the provided solution and further problem details do not specify how backward traversal affects the counting of combinations or its implementation. This omission could leave participants unsure of how to effectively incorporate this functionality into their solutions.
