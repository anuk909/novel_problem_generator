## Prompt

```python
def find_max_length_pairs(dna_sequences, k):
    """
    Given a list of DNA sequences (strings composed of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') and an integer k, design a function to identify the maximum size of a disjoint set of DNA sequences where each sequence in the set can be paired with at least one other sequence with which it shares a common substring of length at least k.

    A set of sequences is disjoint if no sequence appears more than once in the set. The function should aim to include the largest number of DNA sequences in the matching set.

    For example:
    - dna_sequences = ['ACTGAC', 'TGACAC', 'ACTGAG', 'CTGAGC'], k = 3 returns 4 because all sequences can be matched in pairs ('ACTGAC' with 'TGACAC', 'ACTGAG' with 'CTGAGC') sharing at least a substring of length 3.
    - dna_sequences = ['AACCTT', 'GGCCTA'], k = 2 should return 0 as no two sequences can share a common substring of length 2.

    Note:
    - The function should clearly return the number of sequences in the optimal disjoint set.
    - Ensure the disjoint condition is maintained; no sequence should repeat within the resulting set.

## Canonical Solution

```python
    from collections import defaultdict
def find_max_length_pairs(dna_sequences, k):
    def has_common_substring(seq1, seq2, k):
        substrings = {seq1[i:i+k] for i in range(len(seq1)-k+1)}
        return any(seq2[i:i+k] in substrings for i in range(len(seq2)-k+1))

    def build_graph(sequences):
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for i, seq1 in enumerate(sequences):
            for j, seq2 in enumerate(sequences):
                if i != j and has_common_substring(seq1, seq2, k):
                    graph[i].append(j)
        return graph

    def bipartite_maximum_matching(graph):
        # Implementation of a matching algorithm (e.g., Hopcroftâ€“Karp)
        pass

    graph = build_graph(dna_sequences)
    return bipartite_maximum_matching(graph)
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate(['ACTGAC', 'TGACAC', 'ACTGAG', 'CTGAGC'], 3) == 4
    assert candidate(['AACCTT', 'GGCCTA'], 2) == 0
    assert candidate(['AAGT', 'CTTA', 'GTAA'], 2) == 2
    assert candidate(['ACTGACC', 'TGACACC', 'ACTGAGG', 'CTGAGCC'], 4) == 2
    assert candidate(['ACTGACT', 'TGACACT', 'ACTGAAG', 'CTGAGCC', 'AGTAGGG'], 3) == 4

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function to find the maximum size of a disjoint set of DNA sequences where each sequence can be paired with at least one other sequence sharing a common substring of at least length k. The function should return the number of sequences that can be optimally matched.

    Examples:
    - Given ['ACTGAC', 'TGACAC', 'ACTGAG', 'CTGAGC'], k = 3, the function should return 4.
    - Given ['AACCTT', 'GGCCTA'], k = 2, the function should return 0.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 14)
- 5, Unclear problem constraints: The prompt does not specify the constraints on the length of the DNA sequences or the range of the integer k. Without these constraints, it's unclear how to handle edge cases or optimize the solution for performance.
- 4, Ambiguous output: The problem does not clarify how to output or handle cases where no valid sets of pairings exist beyond the given example. It also does not specify if the output should consider the optimal size of more than one disjoint subset that may exist.
- 4, Complex implementation requirement without guidance: The requirement to implement or use a sophisticated algorithm such as bipartite maximum matching (an advanced graph theory algorithm) without any boilerplate or guidance could be overly challenging for the intended audience, unless the competition specifically targets an advanced level.
