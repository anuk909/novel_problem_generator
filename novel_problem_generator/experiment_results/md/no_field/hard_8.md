## Prompt

```python
def enchanted_library(codex, magic_sum):
    """
    On a distant space station, there exists an enchanted library that contains a collection of magical books. Each book in the library has a mystical number associated with it. You are given a list codex that contains the mystical numbers of all books in the library and a magical number magic_sum. Every time a new astronaut arrives at the station, they must perform a ritual by choosing a combination of books such that the sum of the mystical numbers of the selected books equals magic_sum.

    Write a function that returns all possible unique combinations of mystical numbers from the codex (in any order) that sum to magic_sum. Each combination should be a list of numbers, and combinations may include the same number multiple times if it appears multiple times in the codex list.

    Example:
    - If the input is codex = [2,3,6,7] and magic_sum = 7, the output should be [[7], [2,2,3]] because the possible combinations to get a sum of 7 are [7] and [2,2,3].

    Note:
    - The result list should not contain any duplicate combinations.
    - Combination can be in any order.
    - If no combination can be found that adds up to magic_sum, return an empty list.
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def comb_sum(candidates, target, current, start, result):
        if target == 0:
            result.append(current[:])
            return
        elif target < 0:
            return

        for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
            current.append(candidates[i])
            comb_sum(candidates, target - candidates[i], current, i, result)
            current.pop()

    result = []
    comb_sum(codex, magic_sum, [], 0, result)
    return result
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert sorted(candidate([2, 3, 6, 7], 7)) == sorted([[7], [2, 2, 3]])
    assert sorted(candidate([2, 2, 4, 6], 8)) == sorted([[2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 6]])
    assert candidate([5], 5) == [[5]]
    assert candidate([4, 3, 7], 2) == []
    assert sorted(candidate([1, 1, 2, 5, 6], 6)) == sorted([[1, 1, 2, 2], [6]])

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function that takes a list of integers `codex`, representing mystical numbers associated with books, and an integer `magic_sum`. The function should return all unique combinations of numbers from `codex` that sum to `magic_sum`. Each combination should be a list of integers. Consider duplicates in `codex`, and combinations can be in any order. If no valid combination exists, return an empty list.

Example:
- For `codex = [2,3,6,7]` and `magic_sum = 7`, the output should be `[[7], [2,2,3]]`.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: 
- 5, Incorrect Output in Test Cases: The test cases provided in the problem description and the specifications of the canonical solution do not accurately produce unique combinations as required by the prompt. Specifically, the example with input `test([1, 1, 2, 5, 6], 6)` should not include `[1, 1, 2, 2]` since having two '2's does not match the content of the codex list `[1, 1, 2, 5, 6]`; thus, there is only one '2' available. Therefore, the test case contradicts the stated capabilities of the function, which should respect the duplicate count of elements present in `codex`.
- 5, Ambiguity in Combination Generation: The problem statement specifies the function should account for each number's frequency in `codex` when creating combinations. However, it does not clearly specify whether the same number can be reused unlimited times if it is present in the list multiple times. This ambiguity can lead to different implementations, impacting the uniformity and validity of the expected results across various solutions.
- 4, Test Cases May Fail on Proper Implementation: The provided test function assumes a specific sorting of the output, which might not align with different but correct implementations based on the ambiguous problem statement concerning order. If combinations are supposed to be unique and order within them is not supposed to matter, the test should account for this rather than impose an unnatural sorting for validation.
