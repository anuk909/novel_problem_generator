## Prompt

```python
def enchanted_instrument_success_probability(events):
    """
    On a mystical farm, there is an enchanted musical instrument that plays a special song to boost crop growth. The efficiency of the song each day is determined by a sequence of probabilistic events, which form a dependency chain.

    Each event in the sequence can be represented by:
    - An identifier (a distinct integer).
    - A list of tuples, where each tuple contains:
        1. The identifier of a dependent event.
        2. The conditional probability (a float between 0 and 1) that this specific event succeeds only if the dependent event has also succeeded.

    The goal is to compute the overall probability that the entire sequence of events will succeed in a given day.

    Examples:
    - Input: [(1, []), (2, [(1, 0.9)]), (3, [(2, 0.8)])]
      Explanation: Event 1 has no dependencies (always succeeds). Event 2 succeeds with probability 0.9 if Event 1 succeeds. Event 3 succeeds with probability 0.8 if Event 2 succeeds.
      Calculation: Success probability = 1 * 0.9 * 0.8 = 0.72

    Note:
    - The dependency graph defined by the list of events will not contain cycles, but your implementation should handle cycles appropriately by returning a probability of zero for such cases.

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def event_success_probability(event, events_dict, cache):
        if event in cache:
            return cache[event]
        dependencies = events_dict[event]
        if not dependencies:
            cache[event] = 1.0
            return 1.0
        prob = 1.0
        for parent, p in dependencies:
            parent_prob = event_success_probability(parent, events_dict, cache)
            prob *= parent_prob * p
            if parent_prob == 0.0:  # Handle cycles by detecting zero probability
                return 0.0 
        cache[event] = prob
        return prob

    events_dict = {event: dependencies for event, dependencies in events}
    cache = {}
    result = 1.0
    for event in events_dict:
        event_prob = event_success_probability(event, events_dict, cache)
        result *= event_prob
    return result
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert abs(candidate([(1, []), (2, [(1, 0.9)]), (3, [(2, 0.8)])]) - 0.72) < 0.0001
    assert abs(candidate([(1, [])]) - 1.0) < 0.0001
    assert abs(candidate([(1, [(2, 0.5)]), (2, [(1, 0.9)])]) - 0.0) < 0.0001  # Handling of cycle
    assert abs(candidate([(1, []), (2, [(1, 0.95)]), (3, [(2, 0.85)]), (4, [(3, 0.9)])]) - 0.72675) < 0.0001
    assert abs(candidate([(1, [])]) - 1.0) < 0.0001

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Given a list of events with their dependencies and respective conditional probabilities, calculate the overall probability that a chain of events in a day all succeed. An event is defined by its identifier and each dependent event has a conditional success probability. The input list of tuples has the format (event identifier, [(dependent event identifier, conditional probability), ...]). Calculate the success probability of the chain of events for a day. The solution should correctly handle cases where cycles in dependencies would otherwise result in an incorrect computation.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 20)
- 4, Unclear specification on events with no dependencies: The problem statement does not explicitly specify the probability of events that have no dependencies. Though an example infers that such events always succeed (probability = 1.0), this assumption should be clearly stated as a rule in the prompt for absolute clarity to avoid ambiguity.
