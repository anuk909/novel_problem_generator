## Prompt

```python
def enchanted_staircase(n):
    """
    In an enchanted forest, there's a wise old tree that has a mystical staircase which can have n steps (n being any integer from 1 up to and including 50). Each of the steps might contain certain ancient symbols carved onto it. Each symbol manifests based on the step path taken: either 'leaf' if one step is taken or 'owl' if two steps are taken. To ascend the staircase and gain the wisdom of the wise old tree, one must follow specific rules based on these symbols. 

    A traveler can take either 1 or 2 steps at a time. However, the staircase has a magical memory that tracks the last two symbols for each individual step. If anywhere on the staircase the sequence [owl, leaf] appears consecutively on the same step, the staircase collapses, and the journey ends.

    The function should return the total number of distinct ways to ascend the staircase such that it doesn't collapse. As input, you're given the integer n, representing the total number of steps in the staircase.

    Example:
    - For n = 3, the output should be 3. The valid paths up to the third step are: [leaf, leaf, leaf], [leaf, owl], [owl, leaf]
    - For n = 4, the output should be 3. The valid paths up to the fourth step are: [leaf, leaf, leaf, leaf], [leaf, leaf, owl], [leaf, owl, leaf].

    Note:
    - Your algorithm should ensure that paths consisting of [leaf, leaf] or [owl, owl] should be avoided as they can also cause a collapse according to more stringent conditions defined.
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def enchanted_staircase(n):
        if n == 0 or n == 1: return 1
        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        dp[0], dp[1] = 1, 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] - (i > 3 and dp[i-4])
        return dp[n]
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate(1) == 1
    assert candidate(2) == 1
    assert candidate(3) == 3
    assert candidate(4) == 3
    assert candidate(5) == 4
    assert candidate(8) == 9
    assert candidate(12) == 16
    assert candidate(20) == 61
    assert candidate(30) == 180
    assert candidate(50) == 1255
```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function enchanted_staircase(n) that calculates the distinct methods to climb a staircase of n steps without causing it to collapse, considering symbolic generation based on steps taken and sequences that lead to collapsing. Each step generates a 'leaf' if moved by one step or an 'owl' if moved by two steps.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: 
- 4, contradictory_rules: The problem statement contains contradicting rules regarding which sequences cause the staircase to collapse. Initially, it states that the sequence [owl, leaf] specifically causes a collapse, but later expands this to include [leaf, leaf] and [owl, owl] without clear justification or alignment with the earlier part of the problem description.
- 5, incorrect_example: The example provided in the problem description is incorrect based on the rules stated. For n = 4, the output provided is 3, stating that [leaf, owl, leaf] is a valid path, but according to the rule that [owl, leaf] causes collapse, this should not be a valid sequence.
- 4, unclear_task_specification: The problem statement sets a rule that a sequence [owl, leaf] causes collapse when on the same step, which is confusing because the narrative about steps involves sequential progress, not simultaneous occupancy of a step by different symbols.
