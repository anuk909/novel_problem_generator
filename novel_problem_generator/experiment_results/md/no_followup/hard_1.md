# Task ID: hard/1

## Prompt

```python
def ship_log_intervals(events):
    """
    On the haunted ship 'Serpent's Shadow', the navigator keeps logs of anomalous events using intervals. Each event has a start and an end time (both inclusive and given as integers). Sometimes events overlap or touch, and the ship's AI decides to merge them to maintain a clean log.

    The logs are chaotic due to interference by snakes moving through the shipâ€™s electrical systems. Your task is to merge all overlapping and touching intervals and return the minimum number of intervals that can fully cover all the events without any gaps between the events they cover.

    Each interval is represented as [start, end], and intervals are merged if they overlap or touch each other.

    Examples:
    - If the input is [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]], the output should be [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]] as [1, 3] and [2, 6] overlap and can be merged to [1, 6].
    - For [[1, 4], [4, 5], [10, 12]], the merged output should be [[1, 5], [10, 12]] because [1, 4] and [4, 5] touch.

    Note:
    - The input list may be unsorted.
    - If the list of events is empty, return an empty list.
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def merge_intervals(intervals):
        if not intervals:
            return []
        # Sort intervals based on the start time
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        merged = [intervals[0]]
        for current in intervals[1:]:
            last_merged = merged[-1]
            # If the current interval overlaps or touches the last merged interval, merge them
            if current[0] <= last_merged[1] + 1:
                merged[-1] = [last_merged[0], max(last_merged[1], current[1])]
            else:
                merged.append(current)
        return merged

```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]) == [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
    assert candidate([]) == []
    assert candidate([[1, 4], [4, 5], [10, 12]]) == [[1, 5], [10, 12]]
    assert candidate([[6, 8], [1, 9], [2, 4], [4, 7]]) == [[1, 9]]
    assert candidate([[1, 10], [11, 15], [12, 20], [21, 25]]) == [[1, 10], [11, 20], [21, 25]]

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
def ship_log_intervals(events):
    """
    Merge all overlapping and touching intervals from the list of events and return the minimum number of intervals covering all the events without gaps.

    Each interval is represented as [start, end]. Merge intervals if they overlap or touch. Sort intervals by start time before merging.

    Examples:
    - Apply on [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]] to get [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]].
    - Apply on [[1, 4], [4, 5], [10, 12]] to get [[1, 5], [10, 12]].

    Note:
    - If the list is empty, return an empty list.

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: 
- 5, Mismatch in function signature: The 'prompt' details a function definition 'def ship_log_intervals(events):', however, the 'entry_point' field is marked as 'ship_log_intervals', and the 'canonical_solution' uses 'def merge_intervals(intervals):'. This inconsistency could lead to confusion about which function should be effectively implemented or called during the test. This is critical as it will lead to runtime errors if not correctly addressed.
