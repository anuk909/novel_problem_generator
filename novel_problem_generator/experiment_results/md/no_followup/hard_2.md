# Task ID: hard/2

## Prompt

```python
def can_split_wealth(mirror_numbers):
    """
    In the world of enchanted artifacts, you've come across an enchanted mirror that reflects different ancient coin values based on the angle you look at it. While wearing an invisibility cloak, you noticed the mirror sometimes shows magical numbers, which are considered the wealth of cryptic origins possibly stored in multiple blockchain nodes.

    Your task is to determine if it's possible to split these magical numbers into two groups such that the sum of the numbers in each group is the same. This mirrors the partition equal subset sum problem, where it's like checking if you can split blockchain's nodes such that the total checksum on both sides are equal to ensure a balanced network.

    To make it more fitting, imagine each group is responsible for their own separate blockchain, trying to secure equal power to maintain the system decentralized and balanced.

    Example:
    If the mirror_numbers are [1, 5, 11, 5], you can split these numbers into [1, 5, 5] and [11], both adding up to 11.
    If the mirror_numbers are [1, 2, 3, 5], it's not possible to split these in any way that the sums of two groups would be equal.

    Note:
    - The list will always contain positive integers.
    - If the list is empty, return True, as thereâ€™s nothing to split.
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def can_partition(nums):
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        # If total sum is odd, it's not possible to split it equally
        if total_sum % 2 != 0:
            return False
        target = total_sum // 2
        dp = set()
        dp.add(0)

        for num in nums:
            new_dp = dp.copy()
            for s in dp:
                if s + num == target:
                    return True
                new_dp.add(s + num)
            dp = new_dp
        return target in dp
    return can_partition(mirror_numbers)
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([1, 5, 11, 5]) == True
    assert candidate([]) == True
    assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 5]) == False
    assert candidate([12, 7, 7, 7, 7]) == True
    assert candidate([100, 100, 100, 100, 99, 99, 99, 99]) == True
    assert candidate([3, 3, 3, 3, 6]) == False
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: 
- 4, Incorrect Example Explanation: The example provided in the description "[1, 5, 11, 5]" claims that it can be split into [1,5,5] and [11], both adding up to 11. This is mathematically incorrect as the sum of [1, 5, 5] is 11 and the sum of [11] is 11, not matching the explanation that implies two equal groups of the same numbers.
- 5, Method Naming Conflict: The entry point in the problem's metadata is "can_split_wealth", but the actual canonical solution is implemented with the method name "can_partition". This inconsistency will cause runtime errors or confusion unless resolved.
