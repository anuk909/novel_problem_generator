## Prompt

```python
def pirate_treasure_jump(gems):
    """
    A group of pirates has discovered a gemstone mine on an island. The mine contains various types of gems, each placed at specific positions in a straight line. The pirates want to collect as many unique types of gems as possible. However, due to the unstable nature of the mine, each jump a pirate makes must be at least the value of the current gem they're standing on and within the bounds of the gem array.

    Given a list of integers representing the gems, where each gem is marked by a unique identifier (positive integer), write a function that determines the maximum number of unique gem types a pirate can collect starting from the first gem. The pirate can only jump forward by at least the number indicated by the current gem's identifier, and must consider all reachable gems considering this constraint.

    For example, if the input is [2, 3, 1, 4, 3], starting from the first gem (2), the possible positions the pirate can jump to are [4]. From gem 4, he can only jump out of the list, thus he can collect gem types 2 and 4.

    Note:
    - Pirates start at the first gem in the list.
    - Ensure your function handles various combinations optimally and account for edge cases like empty gem list (return 0 in that case).

    Example assertions:
    - For gems = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4], the function should return 2 (collects gems 2 and 4).
    - For an empty list of gems, the function should return 0.

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def pirate_treasure_jump(gems):
        if not gems:
            return 0
        unique_gems = set()
        i = 0
        while i < len(gems):
            current_gem = gems[i]
            next_pos = i + current_gem
            if next_pos >= len(gems):
                unique_gems.add(current_gem)
                break
            unique_gems.add(current_gem)
            i = next_pos
        return len(unique_gems)
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([2, 3, 1, 2, 4]) == 2
    assert candidate([2, 3, 1, 4, 3]) == 2
    assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 1
    assert candidate([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == 1
    assert candidate([]) == 0
    assert candidate([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) == 1

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
def pirate_treasure_jump(gems):
    Given a list of integers representing gems each marked by a unique identifier, write a function to determine the maximum number of unique gem types a pirate can collect starting from the first gem, jumping forward by at least the number indicated by the current gem's identifier. Include all reachable gems considering this constraint.

    Examples:
    - Input: [2, 3, 1, 2, 4], Output: 2
    - Input: [], Output: 0

```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: 
- 5, Ambiguous Problem Statement: The problem does not clarify whether the gem identifier is directly linked to jump value. The examples given where "gem is marked by a unique identifier" could be misunderstood such that each gem's identifier also determines its value for jumping purposes. This may lead to confusion in discerning between gem identifiers and the values to be used for jump calculations.
- 4, Inadequate Example Assertions: The provided test cases are limited and do not cover several edge cases like having multiple gems with the same identifier or more complex jump sequences which test algorithm efficiency and correctness.
- 4, Non-optimal Algorithm Warning: Although labeled as a "warning" under "extra_info", it suggests significant flaws in problem execution and solution strategy. It is implied that the canonical solution may not handle all legal jumps efficiently, which is critical for ensuring the algorithm handles larger or more complicated inputs accurately.
