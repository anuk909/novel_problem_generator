# Task ID: hard/2

## Prompt

```python
def can_split_glowing_creatures(energy_levels):
    """
    You've discovered an undersea cave filled with bioluminescent creatures. Each creature emits a unique glow, represented by an integer in the list `energy_levels`. To reveal hidden treasures, it's essential to split these creatures into two groups with properties related to their glow.

    Your task is to determine if it's possible to split these creatures into two groups such that the sum of energy levels in each group is the same, and the bitwise XOR of all elements within each group must also be zero.

    Return True if such a partition is possible, and False otherwise.

    Examples:
    can_split_glowing_creatures([10, 10, 0, 0]) should return True because you can split them into two groups: [10, 0] and [10, 0], where both groups have equal sum and XOR of elements is zero in each group.
    can_split_glowing_creatures([3, 5, 6, 9]) should return False as no valid partition meets the conditions.

    Note:
    - The list will always contain non-negative integers.
    - The importance of both conditions (equal sum and XOR) is crucial for the successful treasure revelation.
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def can_split_glowing_creatures(energy_levels):
        from functools import lru_cache
        total_sum = sum(energy_levels)
        if total_sum % 2 != 0:
            return False
        target = total_sum // 2

        @lru_cache(None)
        def can_partition(index, current_sum, current_xor):
            if index == len(energy_levels):
                return current_sum == target and current_xor == 0
            current_val = energy_levels[index]
            return (can_partition(index + 1, current_sum + current_val, current_xor ^ current_val) or
                    can_partition(index + 1, current_sum, current_xor))

        return can_partition(0, 0, 0)
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([10, 10, 0, 0]) is True
    assert candidate([3, 5, 6, 9]) is False
    assert candidate([2, 2, 2, 2, 4]) is False
    assert candidate([0, 0, 0, 0]) is True
    assert candidate([15, 5, 5, 20, 5]) is False
```

## Cleaned Prompt

```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: 
- 4, Ambiguity in requirements: The problem statement is ambiguous about the condition that both the sum and the bitwise XOR of all integers in each group should be zero. It specifies that these values should be the same for both groups, but does not clarify if each group's sum and XOR individually need to be zero, or if they should match the other group's values.
- 5, Potential impossibility in constraints: The problem describes that the sum and the bitwise XOR of the integers in each group should be zero to find a solution. However, it seems mathematically improbable or extremely rare that both sums and XORs can uniformly be made zero simultaneously without extremely restrictive constraints on the input set, which hasn't been provided.
