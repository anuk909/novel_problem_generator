## Prompt

```python
def max_product_triangle(matrix):
    """
    Given a square matrix (2D list) of integers, find the maximum product of any triangle in the grid. A triangle in this context is defined by three points that form a triangle shape by connecting directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)

    Examples:
    - For matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], the maximum product triangle is formed by the points with values (5, 3, 9), and the product is 5 * 3 * 9 = 135.
    - For matrix = [[-1, -2, 3], [3, 5, -1], [0, 2, -4]], the maximum product triangle is formed by the points (5, 3, 2) with a product of 5 * 3 * 2 = 30.

    Notes:
    - The matrix will always be of size at least 2x2.
    - The matrix can contain both positive, zero, and negative numbers.
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
	def max_product_triangle(matrix):
	    from itertools import combinations
	    n = len(matrix)
	    max_product = float('-inf')
	    def product(p):
	        return matrix[p[0][0]][p[0][1]] * matrix[p[1][0]][p[1][1]] * matrix[p[2][0]][p[2][1]]
	    for the three points in combinations([(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n)], 3):
	        current_product = product(three points)
	        if current_product > max_product:
	            max_product = current_product
	    return max_product
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) == 135
    assert candidate([[-1, -2, 3], [3, 5, -1], [0, 2, -4]]) == 30
    assert candidate([[0, 2], [9, 3]]) == 0
    assert candidate([[-1, 1], [-1, -1]]) == -1
    assert candidate([[4, 1], [2, 4]]) == 16
```

## Extra Info

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Given a square matrix of integers, find the maximum product of any triangle formed by adjacent points (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

Examples:
- matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], the maximum product triangle is (5, 3, 9) -> product: 135.
- matrix = [[-1, -2, 3], [3, 5, -1], [0, 2, -4]], the maximum product triangle is (5, 3, 2) -> product: 30.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation (<string>, line 13)
- 5, Incorrect definition of adjacency: The problem statement mentions that triangles can be formed by connecting points that are directly adjacent, including diagonally. However, the provided examples involve combinations where the points are not strictly adjacent. This confuses the definition of what an "adjacent triangle" means in terms of grid connectivity.
- 4, Logical flaw in examples: The matrix examples provided and their corresponding solutions don't adhere to the stated adjacency rule. In the examples, points used are not adjacent by any standard grid adjacency rules, leading to confusion about what constitutes a valid triangle.
