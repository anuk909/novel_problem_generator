# Task ID: hard/3

## Prompt

```python
def fourier_transform_frequency_dominant(input_signal):
    """
    Write a function that takes a list of real numbers representing an input signal in the time domain and returns the predominant frequency in the signal using the Fourier Transform.

    For example:
    - If the input_signal is [1, 0, -1, 0], the function should return 1.0 as the frequency since it's a basic sine wave at 1 Hz.
    - For input_signal [0, 1, 0, -1], which is a shift of the previous example, should still return 1.0 as the fundamental frequency does not change with phase shifts.
    
    The frequencies are derived from the indices of the discrete Fourier Transform results, and the frequency with the largest magnitude (ignoring the DC component) is considered predominant.
    
    Note: Use the numpy or equivalent library for computing FFT and assume that the length of the input_signal is always a power of two for simplicity.
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    import numpy as np
    def fourier_transform_frequency_dominant(input_signal):
        fft_result = np.fft.fft(input_signal)
        freq_indices = np.fft.fftfreq(len(input_signal))
        # Eliminate the zero frequency component (DC component)
        fft_result[0] = 0
        dominant_index = np.argmax(np.abs(fft_result))
        return np.abs(freq_indices[dominant_index])
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert abs(candidate([1, 0, -1, 0]) - 1.0) < 1e-6
    assert abs(candidate([0, 1, 0, -1]) - 1.0) < 1e-6
    assert abs(candidate([1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]) - 0.25) < 1e-6
    assert abs(candidate([0, 1]) - 0.5) < 1e-6
    assert abs(candidate([np.sin(2 * np.pi * 2 * t / 8) for t in range(8)]) - 2.0) < 1e-6
```

## Entry Point

`fourier_transform_frequency_dominant`

## Extra Info

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function that takes a list of real numbers representing a signal in time domain and returns the predominant frequency using Fourier Transform. Ignore the zero frequency component in the FFT result. Assume the length of the input list is a power of two.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: 'NoneType' object is not callable
- 5, Unclear sampling rate: The problem does not specify the sampling rate of the input signal, which is crucial to accurately calculate the frequency in Hz. The frequency calculation directly depends on both the length of the signal and its sampling rate. Without this information, the frequency values calculated may not correspond to real-world units (Hz).
- 4, Missing validation for power of two: While the prompt mentions to assume that the length of the input signal is always a power of two, there is no validation check in the code to ensure this condition. This could lead to unexpected behaviors or errors if non-compliant data is inadvertently processed.
