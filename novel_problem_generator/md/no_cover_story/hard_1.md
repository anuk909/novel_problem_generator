## Prompt

```python
def decode_alien_messages(messages, rules):
    """
    In a simulation of an alien IoT network, messages are received in an alien language which must be decoded following specific rules. The rules provide information on how symbols in the alien language should be translated to human-understandable messages. Each rule might suggest recursive translation steps.

    The function should take a list of messages and a dictionary where keys are strings of alien symbols and values are their corresponding translations, which may contain other alien symbols that need further resolving until they translate into a purely human readable form (i.e., English characters).

    The translator should prioritize the longest key matching the beginning of any segment of the message. If there are overlaps in the keys (for example, 'abc' and 'ab'), always prioritize the longest possible match first.

    For example, with messages = ['abc', 'def'] and rules = {'a': 'hello', 'b': ' you', 'c': ' friend', 'd': 'goodbye', 'ef': ' unbeliever'}, the function should return ['hello you friend', 'goodbye unbeliever'].

    Note:
    - Ensure the messages are translated as completely as possible following all rules and tackling possible recursion.

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def decode_alien_messages(messages, rules):
        # Precompute all rule keys sorted by length in descending order for prioritization
        sorted_rules = sorted(rules.keys(), key=len, reverse=True)
        def translate(message):
            translated = ''
            i = 0
            while i < len(message):
                matched = False
                for rule in sorted_rules:
                    if message.startswith(rule, i):
                        translated += translate(rules[rule])
                        i += len(rule)
                        matched = True
                        break
                if not matched:
                    translated += message[i]
                    i += 1
            return translated
        return [translate(msg) for msg in messages]
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate(['abc', 'def'], {'a': 'hello', 'b': ' you', 'c': ' friend', 'd': 'goodbye', 'ef': ' unbeliever'}) == ['hello you friend', 'goodbye unbeliever']
    assert candidate(['x', 'y', 'z'], {'x': 'a', 'y': 'b', 'z': 'c', 'a': 'alpha', 'b': 'beta', 'c': 'gamma'}) == ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma']
    assert candidate(['ab', 'cd'], {'a': 'one ', 'b': 'two', 'c': 'three ', 'd': 'four'}) == ['one two', 'three four']
    assert candidate(['hello'], {}) == ['hello']
    assert candidate(['a b c'], {'a': 'X', 'b': ' Y ', 'c': 'Z'}) == ['X Y Z']

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
def decode_alien_messages(messages, rules):
    """
    Decode messages given in an alien language according to provided rules. The rules may involve recursive references, and always prioritize the longest match first. Ensure translations follow rules recursively and completely.

    Example:
    messages = ['abc', 'def'], rules = {'a': 'hello', 'b': ' you', 'c': ' friend', 'd': 'goodbye', 'ef': ' unbeliever'}
    Expected output: ['hello you friend', 'goodbye unbeliever']

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check. reason: failed: invalid syntax (<string>, line 13)
- 5, Incomplete Canonical Solution: The provided canonical solution has several critical issues which make it non-functional. Firstly, it lacks proper string slicing and indexing within the recursive solve function, leading to potential infinite loops or incorrect recursive calls. Specifically, the line where it is supposed to slice the translation string does not update the variable 'i' correctly, likely causing infinite recursion when a rule's translation contains another rule keyword. Secondly, the actual function decode_alien_messages is missing in the canonical solution. It only consists of helper functions and there is no initial function definition or proper handling of input and output as described in the prompt.
- 4, Ambiguity in Problem Statement: The problem statement lacks clarity on how the function should handle overlapping keys in the rules dictionary where a longer rule key contains a shorter rule key (e.g., 'abcd' and 'abc'). There is no specification on whether the longest possible rule should be matched first or some other strategy should be adopted. This ambiguity can lead to multiple valid interpretations, affecting how participants might implement their solutions.
